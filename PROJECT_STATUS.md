## Current Status:

The application is at MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. All core functionality is implemented and working, but some aspects are simplified or using placeholder content. The application can be used for demonstration purposes and initial user testing.

To run the application:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

For running tests:

```
python tests/run_tests.py
```
